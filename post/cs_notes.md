1. __ init __() is what's called when a user wants to create an instance of a class.
2. **self** is a way to refer to a class instance even though we don't know what the user is actually going to name their instance.
When defining typical class instance methods, like __ init __(), self is the first argument. However, if you recall an instance, when using __ init __(), the user doesn't need to pass a value to this self argument; this is done automatically behind the scenes.
3. Every commit to a repository has a unique identifier called a **hash** (since it is generated by running the changes through a pseudo-random number generator called a hash function). This hash is normally written as a 40-character hexadecimal string like 7c35a3ce607a14953f070f0f83b5d74c2296ef93, but most of the time, you only have to give Git the first 6 or 8 characters in order to identify the commit you mean.
Hashes are what enable Git to share data efficiently between repositories. If two files are the same, their hashes are guaranteed to be the same. Similarly, if two commits contain the same files and have the same ancestors, their hashes will be the same as well. Git can therefore tell what information needs to be saved where by comparing hashes rather than comparing entire files.
3. pd.query('_____ ')
``` 
df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 2), columns=list('ab'))
df.query('a > b')
df[df.a > df.b]   # same result as the previous expression
```

4. To create strings that span multiple lines, triple single quotes ''' or triple double quotes """ are used to enclose the string.
