# Personalized Data Science Learning Path

Inspired by [Daniel Bourke](https://mrdbourke.com/blog/aimastersdegree) who created a self-learning AI degree using online courses and books, I decided to design a self-learning path for data science myself.


## My Goal
1. Gain enough relevant knowledge and have the ability of building projects independently. 
2. Combine data science with the area I'm interested (i.e. geology, earth science, atmospheric science), and carry out interdisciplinary 
   projects to benefit both fields.
3. Further develop myself in terms of learning ability, creativity etc.
