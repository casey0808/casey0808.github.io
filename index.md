I started this website as a place to document everything I learned while going through a career change,
thus it is more of a learning record rather than a portfolio.

## About Me

I am Casey, currently living in Shanghai. 

I worked as a data analyst for almost two years, and switched to front-end developer at the end of 2019.

With passion for data visualization and web development, I want to combine the knowledge of both fields, create aesthetic and user-friendly websites, and showcase data in better ways.
