# Welcome to the Lane
<br/>
I started this website as a place to document everything I learned while going through a career change,
thus it is more of a learning record rather than a portfolio.

## About Me
I live in Shanghai, currently as a data analyst.

I graduated in 2016 with a master degree in Applied Geosciences.

With passion for data science and programming, I want to combine the knowledge of earth science with data science ,and hopefully make contribution to both fields.
